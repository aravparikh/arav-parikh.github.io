## Certificates

### Python for Data Science, AI & Development - IBM
<a href="images/first python course.pdf" class="button">View Certificate</a>

**What I learned:**  
I learned the essentials of Python programming, including handling variables, data types, flow control (like loops and conditionals), and writing functions. I explored data analysis libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations and Pandas for data manipulation, enabling me to work with and analyze data sets efficiently. Additionally, I touched on data visualization with Matplotlib, creating meaningful charts and plots, and began understanding machine learning concepts and how to structure data science workflows. This course gave me foundational skills to dive into data science and AI projects with Python confidently.

**What I learned:**  
I learned to build and evaluate regression models to predict continuous outcomes. Using Python libraries like Scikit-Learn, I explored various regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and polynomial regression. The course covered essential concepts like model training, testing, and tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy, as well as understanding key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance. This course equipped me with practical skills to implement and refine regression models for predictive analysis tasks.

**What I learned:**  
This course focused on interpreting medical research and assessing its accuracy and reliability. I learned how to identify bias in studies, understand statistical significance, and evaluate research methods. Additionally, it taught me to critically analyze scientific claims and identify misleading conclusions, which has strengthened my ability to assess medical information accurately. These skills are valuable for evaluating the credibility of studies in healthcare, especially in understanding research on chronic pain and misdiagnosis.
