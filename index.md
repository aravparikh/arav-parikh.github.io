### What I learned: 
I learned the essentials of Python programming, including handling variables, data types, flow control (like loops and conditionals), and writing functions. I explored data analysis libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations and Pandas for data manipulation, enabling me to work with and analyze data sets efficiently. Additionally, I touched on data visualization with Matplotlib, creating meaningful charts and plots, and began understanding machine learning concepts and how to structure data science workflows. This course gave me foundational skills to dive into data science and AI projects with Python confidently.
