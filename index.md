**What I learned:**  
I learned the essentials of Python programming, including handling variables, data types, flow control (like loops and conditionals), and writing functions. I explored data analysis libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations and Pandas for data manipulation, enabling me to work with and analyze data sets efficiently. Additionally, I touched on data visualization with Matplotlib, creating meaningful charts and plots, and began understanding machine learning concepts and how to structure data science workflows. This course gave me foundational skills to dive into data science and AI projects with Python confidently.

**What I learned:**  
I learned to investigate and summarize data sets to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses. Using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, I practiced cleaning and transforming raw data, identifying key trends, and creating visualizations that highlight insights. I also learned statistical techniques to better understand relationships within data, enabling me to draw preliminary conclusions and prepare data for machine learning models. This course strengthened my ability to explore data thoroughly, helping me make data-driven decisions more effectively.

**What I learned:**  
I learned to build and evaluate regression models to predict continuous outcomes. Using Python libraries like Scikit-Learn, I explored various regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and polynomial regression. The course covered essential concepts like model training, testing, and tuning hyperparameters to improve accuracy, as well as understanding key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance. This course equipped me with practical skills to implement and refine regression models for predictive analysis tasks.

**What I learned:**  
I learned how to think critically about medical research and scientific studies. The course covered the basics of study design, data interpretation, and the peer review process, which helped me spot reliable studies and recognize misleading ones. I also gained a better understanding of key statistical concepts like causation versus correlation and learned about common biases in research. Now, I feel more confident in evaluating health information and can better identify credible sources, especially when faced with the kind of misinformation often spread on social media.
